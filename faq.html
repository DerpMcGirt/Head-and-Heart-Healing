        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <h3>Do you take private insurance and state-funded insurance?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes! We are constantly working to be in network with as many insurance providers as we can to make therapy accessible to anyone in need.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you see children?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes! Adults aren't the only ones who can benefit from therapy. We can schedule children as young as six-years-old.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I do virtual visits?</h3>
        <p>
            Of course! We all lead busy lives. I want to meet your needs. We offer in-office visits in Greensboro, NC, but if you live in Kentucky or just can't make an in person meet, we can schedule a telehealth session through our patient portal!
        </p>

        <h3>What if I'm paying out of pocket?</h3>
        <p>
            No problem! We can take cash in-office or credit card payments in the patient portal. We also accept Venmo, Zelle, and CashApp!
