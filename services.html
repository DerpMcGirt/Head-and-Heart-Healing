            <p>
                Trauma therapy is designed to help individuals process and heal from the effects of traumatic
                experiences. It allows individuals to manage symptoms like flashbacks, triggers, and intense
                emotions by developing coping mechanisms and building resilience in a safe and supportive
                environment. The ultimate aim is to reduce the impact of trauma on daily life.

                and well-being. It involves fostering a positive mindset about oneself, with the goal of challenging
                negative thoughts and beliefs from oneself and others.
