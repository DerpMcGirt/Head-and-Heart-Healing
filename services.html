                <h3>Trauma</h3>
                <p class="indented">
                    Trauma therapy is designed to help individuals process and heal from the effects of traumatic
                    experiences. It allows individuals to manage symptoms like flashbacks, triggers, and intense
                    emotions by developing coping mechanisms and building resilience in a safe and supportive
                    environment. The ultimate aim is to reduce the impact of trauma on daily life.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    We go at a pace that is comfortable for you. You share whatever part of your story you're
                    comfortable with. Some days, we might spend only five minutes talking about it; other days, we might
                    not discuss it at all because we're celebrating the good moments in life and don't want to focus on
                    the difficult parts that day. We work on finding the right healing process for you, not anyone else.
                </p>
                <p class="indented">
                    Sometimes, it's dark humor or sarcasm, being snippy, or throwing shade in a certain direction. Other
                    times, it's shedding tears or just being quiet while in the moment. No judgments—we all get to feel
                    how we feel. The point is, it's not a journey that goes in a straight line.

                <p class="indented">
                    Some of us have had unpleasant experiences that can result in religious trauma, filling us with
                    uncertainty and doubt; We can work together to address these concerns.

                    Affirmation therapy is a form of psychotherapy that uses positive self-talk to improve mental health
                    and well-being. It involves fostering a positive mindset about oneself, with the goal of challenging
                    negative thoughts and beliefs from oneself and others.
