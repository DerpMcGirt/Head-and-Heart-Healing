        <h1>Welcome to Head & Heart Healing</h1>
        <h3>Your Journey to Wellness Begins Now!</h3>


        <img src="/assets/img/happiness.jpg" alt="Happiness" id="happiness-img" />

        <p>
            At Head & Heart Healing, we bring a wealth of life experience to our practice, understanding the
            complexities of relationships and personal growth. Our team has navigated various personal challenges,
            including marriage, parenting, divorce, and blended families, and we value genuine conversations that
            build trust and therapeutic relationships.
        </p>

        <p>
            We maintain strong, supportive relationships with our clients and their families, and we believe in
            discovering one's true calling at any stage in life. Our approach is infused with positivity and humor,
            often using laughter as a coping mechanism. We enjoy learning about a wide range of topics and hold firm
            spiritual beliefs without imposing them on others.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our sessions, we use analogies and references from movies, books, music, and social media to connect
            with our clients. We focus on building rapport and trust, allowing clients to express their thoughts and
            feelings openly. At Head & Heart Healing, we help clients explore their goals, whether they seek a
            different perspective, validation, or simply someone to listen.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            “I’ve been seeing Denise for a few years now, and from the very beginning, she’s been incredibly easy to
            talk to. She’s helped me navigate some of the most challenging times in my life, always with compassion and
            understanding. Denise has been there for me through both the ups and downs, and she’s genuinely one of the
            most honest and caring people I’ve ever spoken with. She has a way of making things feel comfortable, and
            even fun, which has really helped me open up and connect in a way I’ve never experienced with other
            therapists. Scheduling with her is always easy, and she’s been flexible when I’ve needed it, which has been
            such a relief. It’s usually hard for me to find a therapist I can connect with, but that’s never been an
            issue with Denise. She truly creates a supportive, welcoming environment, and I’m grateful for the positive
            impact she’s had on my life”

        <blockquote>
            "Being a middle-aged man from eastern Kentucky I was initially adamant about seeing a therapist. After
            having a couple of sessions with Denise I quickly realized the stigma associated with therapy I’d learned as
            a child was completely unfounded. Over the past three years Denise has guided me on a journey of healing
            through self awareness, arriving at a place where I feel true happiness. I have become a better father,
            friend and family member using the skills Denise has taught me. After all these years I still get excited in
            the days leading up to our sessions, wondering what I will learn from her next."

            "My visits with Denise are always eye-opening and full of self-discoveries. Like talking with an old friend,
            she really breaks the mold set by the previous therapists I've seen. Sometimes I ramble on for the entire
            hour while she listens patiently, offering her perspective at the end. Other times, we just play catch-up
            and share funny stories. Either way, I learn something new about myself each time, and I always look forward
            to talking with her!"
